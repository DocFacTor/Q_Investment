## Qmod: A Python class implementing the Abel-Hayashi "Marginal Q" model of investment.

This implementation follows Professor Christopher D. Carroll's [lecture notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/Investment/qModel/).
Numerical solution of the Abel-Hayashi marginal Q Investment Model.

The Qmod class' current functions include:
- Solution of the model, obtaining its policy rule.
- Drawing of the model's phase diagram.
- Simulation of the model's dynamics starting from a given level of capital.

Examples of these uses can be found in [Examples.ipynb](https://github.com/Mv77/Q_Investment/blob/master/Examples.ipynb).

[Examples_structural_change.ipynb](https://github.com/Mv77/Q_Investment/blob/master/Examples_structural_change.ipynb) provides examples of how to obtain the model's dynamic reaction to changes in parameters.
The examples include sudden changes, and changes that are announced with anticipation.
