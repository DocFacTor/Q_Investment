# # Examples of structural change in the Abel-Hayashi "Q" investment model
#
# This notebook illustrates the dynamic behavior of capital and its marginal
# value in the Abel-Hayashi model of investment when structural changes happen.
#
# I simulate the changes discussed in Prof. Christopher D. Carroll's graduate
# Macroeconomics [lecture notes](http://www.econ2.jhu.edu/people/ccarroll/public/lecturenotes/Investment/qModel/):
# productivity, corporate tax rate, and investment tax credit changes.
#
# For each change I display the behavior of the model in two different
# contexts:
# * The change takes place at $t=0$ without notice.
# * The change is announced at $t=0$ but takes place at $t=5$.
