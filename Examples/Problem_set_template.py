# # YOUR NAME
#
# This notebook is a template showing you how to use some tools that will be useful for problem set 5.
#
# The tools are:
# 1. Qmod: an implementation of the q-Model as a class in python. This is used to obtain phase diagrams.
# 2. Dolo: a general purpose tool used to represent and solve economic models. This is used to compute optimal responses.
#
# The use of both tools will make us have to handle two representations of our problems, one as a Qmod object, and one as a Dolo model.
#
# Start by loading the tools we will be using.

# Preamble: import the packages we will be using

# Usual packages
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from copy import deepcopy
from dolo import *
import dolo.algos.perfect_foresight as pf
import pandas as pd

# Import the Qmod python code from external file

# Since the Qmod class is in other folder we need to
# change the path.
import sys
sys.path.append('../')
from Qmod.Q_investment import Qmod

# %% [markdown]
# I then define a function that takes two Qmod objects and plots their phase diagrams in the same figure.

    Draws the phase diagram of the Qmodel under two different sets of

    Parameters:
        - mod1    : Qmod object representing the first set of parameter values.
        - mod1    : Qmod object representing the second set of parameter values.
        - k0      : initial value for capital.

# Now I create a base model parametrization.

# Base parameters

# Discount factor and return factor

R = 1/beta

# Tax rate

# Share of capital in production
alpha = 0.33

# Adjustment costs
omega = 1

# Investment tax credit
zeta = 0

# Depreciation rate
delta = 0.1

# Technological factor
psi = 1

# %% [markdown]
# And create the objects representing the model. First in Qmod:

# %%
## Qmod python class

# Create the object.
Qmodel = Qmod(beta, tau, alpha, omega, zeta, delta, psi)
# Solve to find the steady state and policy rule.
Qmodel.solve()

# %% [markdown]
# Then in Dolo:

# %%
## Dolo

# First import the external file with the model description.
QDolo = yaml_import("../Dolo/Q_model.yaml")

# Then replace the default parameters with our desired ones.
QDolo.set_calibration(alpha = alpha, delta = delta, omega = omega)

# We do not pass R, psi, tau, or itc because they are handled not as parameters
# but exogenous variables that can change over time. (see below)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Dynamic response example: changes in productivity.
#
# I now give an example of how to use Dolo to solve for the optimal behavior of the firm.
# The basic idea is:
# 1. We will create a path for the exogenous variables of the model.
# 2. Dolo assumes that this path is announced to the firm at the first time period, and it computes the optimal dynamics according to these paths.
# %%
# Set up the basic features of the simulation

# Total simulation time
T = 100
# Initial level of capital
k0 = Qmodel.kss

# %% {"code_folding": []}
# Design the shock:

# for this example, I am assuming that productivity increases and then
# goes back to the original level.

# Check the pattern of the shock
plt.figure()

# Dolo receives a DataFrame with the full future paths for ALL exogenous
# variables. So we create one:
Exog = pd.DataFrame({'R':[R]*T,
                     'tau':[tau]*T,
                     'itc_1':[zeta]*T,
                     'psi':Psi_sequence})

# Examine the first few entries.
Exog.head()
# Note all other variables are left constant.

# %%
# Now use the "perfect foresight" dolo solver

# Response is a DataFrame with the paths of every variable over time.
# It adds information we don't need on the first row. So we delete it
response = response[1:]

# Inspect the first few elements.
response.head()

# %% [markdown]
# # IMPORTANT
#
# Because of the way the model is implemented, it does not keep track of $\lambda_t$ or $ITC_t$, but  $\lambda_{t+1}$ and $ITC_{t+1}$ instead. 
#
# Thus, lambda_1 in row 1 corresponds to $\lambda_2$. Same with the ITC.

# %% [markdown]
# # Plots
#
# Now we can use Qmod to plot the phase diagrams and add the optimal dynamics that we just found.

# %%
# Draw the two phase diagrams and save them in an object
# to add the plots of dynamics later.

# Copy the initial model, set the higher psi and re-solve
Q_high_psi = deepcopy(Qmodel)
Q_high_psi.psi = psi_high
Q_high_psi.solve()

# Now we draw the phase diagrams of our base model "Qmodel"
# and the new one "Q_high_psi", and store the plot in
# object "ax"
ax = phase_diagrams(mod1 = Qmodel, mod2 = Q_high_psi)

# Now we can add the behavior of lambda and k to the diagram.
